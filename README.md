##What does this thing do?
It makes a silly little banner at the top of your website. Currently it only shows for the holidays of Christmas, Fourth of July, and (American) Thanksgiving. The pattern is pretty straight forward and can be used to implement other holidays. YOu just need to reference the holidayMessage.js file and have a reference to jQuery in your header. There isn't much styling to it.

###Is that it?
I'm afraid so. It really is that simple. It uses the JavaScript date object, so if you want to base it on non-gregorian dates, you'll have to update it every year, or use the getFullYear() function of JavaScript. Then you can plan out for several centuries in advance. Just be careful, the longer you make your switch statement, the longer your webpage will take to load on the user's computer.
